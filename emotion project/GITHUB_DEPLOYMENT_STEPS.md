This document provides step-by-step instructions to upload your Moodify emotion detection project to GitHub.

## üìã Prerequisites Checklist

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- [ ] A GitHub account
- [ ] Git installed on your computer
- [ ] Your Moodify project files ready
- [ ] Internet connection

## üîß Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Navigate to https://github.com and log in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Fill in the repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `emotion-detection-project`

5. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Copy the Repository URL

After creating the repository, you'll see a page with quick setup instructions. Copy the HTTPS URL which looks like:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/emotion-detection-project.git
```

### Step 3: Connect Your Local Project to GitHub

Open PowerShell or Command Prompt and navigate to your project folder:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\nandi\emotion project"
```

Connect your local repository to the GitHub repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username):

```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/emotion-detection-project.git
```

### Step 4: Push Your Code to GitHub

Push your code to GitHub:

```powershell
git push -u origin main
```

If you get an error about the branch name, try:

```powershell
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 5: Verify the Upload

1. Go to your GitHub repository page
2. Refresh the page
3. You should now see all your project files

## üîê Authentication (If Required)

If you encounter authentication issues:

### Option 1: Use GitHub Personal Access Token

3. Give it a name (e.g., "Moodify Project")
4. Select scopes: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the generated token
7. When prompted for password, use this token instead

### Option 2: Use GitHub CLI (Recommended)

1. Install GitHub CLI: https://cli.github.com/
2. Run: `gh auth login`
3. Follow the authentication prompts

## üÜò Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "Updates were rejected"

If you get an error like "Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind":

```powershell
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
git push -u origin main
```

### Issue: "Authentication failed"

1. Ensure you're using a personal access token instead of your password
2. Check that your GitHub username is correct in the repository URL

### Issue: "Repository not found"

1. Verify the repository URL is correct
2. Ensure the repository exists on GitHub
3. Check your internet connection

## üîÑ Making Future Updates

To update your repository after making changes:

1. Check status: `git status`
